# Introduction
Do you love 8-bit arcade games?

Do get excited when building electronics?

Do you enjoy soldering kits?

ðŸ¤· How about riding unicorns? ðŸ¤·

Well, if the answer is yes to any of them then Tinycade comes to the rescue ðŸš€

The Tinycade kit is designed to be a quite simple soldering kit, to serve as an introductory experience in the world of electronics while showcasing advanced possibilities that such simple hardware can handle!

It is based on the tiny, yet powerful, microcontroller Attiny85 which already comes pre-programmed with an open-source game from the maker community! Note that we do not sell the software on this kit, only the hardwareðŸ˜Š.

As usual, you have the option to re-program your Tinycade via the programming interface on the back, using an ISP programmer. This way you can re-load other open-source games, use it as an educational gaming platform and make your own mini-game, or even hack it and find other cool usages around it ðŸ‘¾.

To make the kit even cooler and arcad-y, we prepared dedicated graphics for the PCB ðŸ˜ƒ

# Assembly instructions:

The Tinycade was designed to be quite simple and straightforward to build. The only tool that you will need from your side is just a soldering iron! You can use the following picture as an assembly reference:

All resistors have the same value by design, so there is no issue in mixing and matching them ðŸ˜Š. You will need to watch for the polarity of the buzzer, LED, and the Attiny85 MCU which is always marked on the board.

# Get it up and running:

Connect a CR2032 coin cell on the back, turn on the switch, and get ready to make a highscore! That's it, your cute mini 8-bit arcade machine is readyðŸ˜€. You can upload a new game into your Tinycade, code your own or even hack it and use it any other way you think of ðŸ¦„
